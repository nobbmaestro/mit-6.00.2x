## Problem 7-1

Answer the next questions on machine learning, related to the following data. Consider the following 6 people who are either happy or unhappy and the data we know on them:

|                                  | Person 1  | Person 2  |Person 3   | Person 4  | Person 5  | Person 6|

| Happy/Unhappy                    | happy    | happy    | happy    | unhappy   | unhappy   | unhappy |
| Income (dollars)                | 10k    | 30k    | 90k    | 100k    | 120k    | 60k     |
| Distance from North Pole (miles) | 4k        | 10k    | 5k        | 1k        | 1k        | 6k      |

Using the Manhattan distance and looking only at "Income" and "Distance from North Pole", which two people are closest and farthest?

1. closest: Person 1 and Person 2 ||| farthest: Person 4 and Person 5
2. closest: Person 4 and Person 5 ||| farthest: Person 1 and Person 5
3. closest: Person 4 and Person 5 ||| farthest: Person 5 and Person 6
4. closest: Person 3 and Person 4 ||| farthest: Person 5 and Person 6
5. closest: Person 3 and Person 4 ||| farthest: Person 1 and Person 5
