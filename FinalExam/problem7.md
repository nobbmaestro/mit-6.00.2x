## Problem 7-1
Answer the next questions on machine learning, related to the following data. Consider the following 6 people who are either happy or unhappy and the data we know on them:

|                                  | Person 1  | Person 2  |Person 3   | Person 4  | Person 5  | Person 6|

| Happy/Unhappy	                   | happy	   | happy	   | happy	   | unhappy   | unhappy   | unhappy |
| Income (dollars)	               | 10k	   | 30k	   | 90k	   | 100k	   | 120k	   | 60k     |
| Distance from North Pole (miles) | 4k	       | 10k	   | 5k	       | 1k	       | 1k	       | 6k      |
| Continents Visited	           | Europe	   | Europe	   | Europe	   | Europe	   | Europe	   | Europe  |

Using the Manhattan distance and looking only at "Income" and "Distance from North Pole", which two people are closest and farthest?
1. closest: Person 1 and Person 2 ||| farthest: Person 4 and Person 5
2. closest: Person 4 and Person 5 ||| farthest: Person 1 and Person 5
3. closest: Person 4 and Person 5 ||| farthest: Person 5 and Person 6
4. closest: Person 3 and Person 4 ||| farthest: Person 5 and Person 6
5. closest: Person 3 and Person 4 ||| farthest: Person 1 and Person 5
